#1. A list behaves like a container, and it is able to contain more than one value. Create a list with the values as shown in the example below.
# Answer:
aList = ['Hello',0,20.0,'World']
aList[0] # index of zero value
aList[1:3] # from index 1 to 3 values.
aList[3] # indes 3 value

#2.A list can be modified, and more elements can be added to an existing list. Use the append(x) function to add some more items to the list to produce the same content shown in the sample below.
# Answer:
 aList = ['Hello', 0] 
aList.append(20.0) # adding element to the end of the list
aList.append('World') # adding element to the end of the list
aList[0] # index of zero value
aList[1:3] # from index 1 to 3 values.
aList[3] # index 3 value

#3.A list can be modified, and elements can be removed from an existing list. Use the remove(x) function to remove some items from the list shown in the sample given below so that the list is left with the following content: ['hello', 'python','programming'].
#Answer:
aList = ['hello', 'i', 'love', 'python', 'programming']
aList.remove('i') # removing element i
aList.remove('love') # removing element LOve
